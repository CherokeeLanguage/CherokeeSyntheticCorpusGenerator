Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:	ᏑᎾᎴᏃ ᏄᎵᏍᏔᏅ, ᏂᎦᏛ ᏄᏂᎬᏫᏳᏒ ᎠᏥᎸ-ᎠᏁᎶᎯ ᎠᎴ ᏗᏂᎳᏫᎩ ᎠᏁᎲ ᎠᏫ ᎤᏂᏃᎮᎴ ᎢᏳᎾᏛᏁᏗᏱ ᏥᏌ ᎤᏂᎯᏍᏗᏱ.

Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,	ᎿᏉᏃ ᏧᏓᏏ ᎾᏍᎩ ᎤᎶᏄᎮᎸᎯ ᎤᏙᎴᎰᏒ ᏓᎫᎪᏓᏁᎸᎢ ᎤᏁᏟᏴᏎ ᎤᏓᏅᏛᎢ, ᎠᎴ ᏄᏂᎬᏫᏳᏒ ᎠᏥᎸ-ᎠᏁᎶᎯ ᎠᎴ ᏧᎾᏛᏐᏅᎯ ᏙᎤᏲᎮᎴ ᏦᎠᏍᎪᎯ ᎠᏰᎵ-ᎠᏕᎸ ᏧᎾᎬᏩᎶᏗ,

Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, "Prophesy!" The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.	ᎢᎦᏛᏃ ᎤᎾᎴᏅᎮ ᏕᎬᏩᎵᏥᏍᏆᏍᎨᎢ, ᎠᎴ ᎤᎧᏛ ᎬᏭᏢᏁᎮᎢ, ᎠᎴ ᎠᏍᏈᏅ ᏕᎬᏩᏂᏗᏍᎨᎢ, ᎠᎴ ᎯᎠ ᏂᎬᏩᏪᏎᎮᎢ, ᎭᏙᎴᎰᎯ; ᎠᎴ ᎨᏥᏅᏏᏓᏍᏗ ᏕᎬᏩᏂᎮᎢ.

When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, "Peace be to you."

Simon Peter said to them, "I'm going fishing." They told him, "We are also coming with you." They immediately went out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing.	ᏌᏩᏂ ᏈᏓ ᎯᎠ ᏂᏚᏪᏎᎸᎩ; ᏥᎦᏯᎷᏂ. ᎯᎠ ᏅᎬᏩᏪᏎᎸᎩ; ᎠᏴ ᎾᏍᏉ ᏓᏕᏏ. ᎤᏁᏅᏒᎩ, ᎩᎳᏉᏃ ᎢᏴᏛ ᏥᏳᎯ ᎤᎾᏣᏅᎩ; ᎾᎯᏳᏃ ᏒᏃᏱ ᎥᏝ ᎪᎱᏍᏗ ᏳᏂᏂᏴᎮᎢ.

He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some." They cast it therefore, and now they weren't able to draw it in for the multitude of fish.	ᎯᎠᏃ ᏂᏚᏪᏎᎸᎩ; ᏥᏳᎯ ᎠᎦᏘᏏᏗᏢ ᎢᏥᎦᏯᎷᎥᎦ, ᏙᏓᏥᏩᏛᎯᏃ. ᎰᏩᏃ ᎤᏂᎦᏯᎷᏅᎩ, ᎿᏉᏃ ᎥᏝ ᏰᎵ ᎬᏩᎾᏎᎯᏍᏗ ᏱᎨᏎᎢ, ᏅᏓᎦᎵᏍᏙᏗᏍᎬᎩ ᎤᏂᏣᏛ ᎠᏣᏗ.
That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It's the Lord!"

Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and even though there were so many, the net wasn't torn.	ᏌᏩᏂ ᏈᏓ ᏭᏣᏅᎩ, ᎠᎴ ᏙᏱ ᏭᎾᏏᏃᎸᎩ ᎠᎦᏯᎷᏗ ᎠᎧᎵᏬᎯ ᏣᏁᏆ ᎠᏣᏗ, ᏍᎪᎯᏧᏈ ᎯᏍᎩᏍᎪᎯ ᏦᎢᎦᎵ ᎤᏂᎥᎩ. ᎾᏍᎩᏒᎦᏃ ᎾᏂᎥᎽ ᎠᏎᏃ ᎠᎦᏯᎷᏗ ᎥᏝ ᏳᏲᏤᎢ.

So when they had eaten their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you."

He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for me?" Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, "Do you have affection for me?"

When they were past the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened to them by itself.

But he, beckoning to them with his hand to be silent, declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He said, "Tell these things to James, and to the brothers."

Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon.

Paul wanted to have him go out with him, and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.	ᎾᏍᎩ ᏉᎳ ᎤᏚᎸᎲᎩ ᎤᏘᏅᏍᏗᏱ; ᎤᎱᏍᏕᏎᎸᎩᏃ ᏅᏓᏳᎵᏍᏙᏔᏅᎩ ᎠᏂᏧᏏ ᎾᎿ ᏓᏁᏩᏗᏒᎢ, ᏂᎦᏛᏰᏃ ᎠᏂᎦᏔᎲᎩ ᎤᏙᏓ ᎠᎪᎢ ᎨᏒᎢ.

It happened, as we were going to prayer, that a certain girl having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by fortune telling.	ᎯᎠᏃ ᏄᎵᏍᏔᏅᎩ, ᎠᏓᏙᎵᏍᏙᏗᏱ ᎣᎨᏅ, ᎩᎶ ᎢᏳᏍᏗ ᎠᏛ, ᎠᏓᏅᏙ ᎠᏙᏂᏍᎩ ᎤᏯᎢ, ᏙᎦᏠᏒᎩ, ᎾᏍᎩ ᎤᏣᏛ ᏧᎬᏩᎶᏗ ᏓᏩᏛᎡᎲᎩ ᎬᏩᎾᏝᎢ ᎠᏙᏂᏍᎬ ᎬᏗᏍᎩ.

She was doing this for many days. But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!" It came out that very hour.

Now I declare to you, brothers, the Good News which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you also stand,	ᎠᎴᏬ ᎢᏓᎵᏅᏟ, ᎬᏂᎨᏒ ᏂᏨᏴᏁᎭ ᎣᏍᏛ ᎧᏃᎮᏛ, ᎾᏍᎩ ᏥᏨᏯᎵᏥᏙᏁᎸᎩ, ᎠᎴ ᎾᏍᎩ ᎾᏍᏉ ᏥᏕᏣᏓᏂᎸᏨ, ᎠᎴ ᎾᏍᎩ ᎤᎵᏂᎩᏛ ᏥᏕᏥᏂᏴᎭ;

For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.

For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not "Yes and no," but in him is "Yes."	ᎤᏁᎳᏅᎯᏰᏃ ᎤᏪᏥ ᏥᏌ ᎦᎶᏁᏛ, ᎾᏍᎩ ᎢᏤᎲ ᎢᏨᏯᎵᏥᏙᏁᎸᎯ ᏥᎩ, ᎾᏍᎩ ᎠᏴ, ᎠᎴ ᏏᎵᏪᎾ, ᎠᎴ ᏗᎹᏗ ᎢᏨᏯᎵᏥᏙᏁᎸᎯ ᏥᎩ, ᎥᎥ ᎠᎴ ᎥᏝ ᎤᏛᏗᏱ ᎥᏝ ᏲᎦᏛᏁᎢ, ᎥᎥᏍᎩᏂ ᎤᏩᏒ ᎤᏛᏗᏱ ᎬᏂᎨᏒ ᏃᎬᏁᎸᎩ.
For however many are the promises of God, in him is the "Yes." Therefore also through him is the "Amen," to the glory of God through us.	ᎾᎦᏛᏰᏃ ᎤᏚᎢᏍᏔᏅᎢ ᎤᏁᎳᏅᎯ ᎾᏍᎩ Ꮎ ᎢᏳᏩᏂᏌᏛ, ᎥᎥ ᎬᏛᏗ, ᎠᎴ ᎤᏙᎯᏳᎯᏯ ᎨᏐ ᎾᏍᎩ ᎢᏳᏩᏂᏌᏛ, ᎾᏍᎩ ᎤᏁᎳᏅᎯ ᎠᏥᎸᏉᏙᏗᏱ ᎠᏴ ᎢᏲᎬᏁᏗᏱ.

Moreover, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the assemblies of Macedonia;	ᎠᎴᏬ ᎢᏓᎵᏅᏟ, ᎬᏂᎨᏒ ᏂᏨᏴᏁᎭ, ᎤᏁᎳᏅᎯ ᎬᏩᎦᏘᏯ ᎤᏓᏁᏗ ᎨᏒ ᎾᏍᎩ ᏚᏁᎸ ᏧᎾᏁᎶᏗ ᏚᎾᏓᏡᏩᏗᏒ ᎹᏏᏙᏂ ᎠᏁᎯ;

So we urged Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace.	ᎾᏍᎩ ᎢᏳᏍᏗ ᏓᏓᏏ ᎣᏥᏔᏲᏎᎸᎩ, ᎾᏍᎩ ᏄᏍᏛ ᎤᎴᏅᎲᎢ, ᎾᏍᎩᏯ ᎢᏳᏛᏁᏗᏱ ᎤᏍᏆᏗᏍᏗᏱ ᎢᏤᎲ ᎤᏠᏱ ᎢᏣᏓᏁᏗᏱ ᏂᏨᏁᎲᎢ.

It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints,	ᎾᏃ ᎤᎾᏓᏅᏘ ᏗᏍᏕᎸᏗᏱ ᎤᎬᏩᎵ, ᎠᏎᏉᏉ ᏱᏨᏲᏪᎳᏁᎭ.

It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because, both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all are partakers with me of grace.

For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,	ᎯᎠᏰᏃ ᎾᏍᎩ ᎹᏓᎩᏏᏕᎩ, ᎤᎬᏫᏳᎯ ᏎᏓᎽ, ᎠᏥᎸ-ᎨᎶᎯ ᎨᏎᎢ ᎤᏁᎳᏅᎯ ᏩᏍᏛ ᎦᎸᎳᏗ ᎡᎯ ᎤᏤᎵᎦ, ᎾᏍᎩ ᎡᏆᎭᎻ ᏥᏚᏠᏎ ᏧᏨᏏᏗᏒ ᏫᏚᎰᏅᎯ ᎤᏂᎬᏫᏳᎯ, ᎠᎴ ᎣᏍᏛ ᏧᏁᏤᎴᎢ;

They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the body of Abraham,	ᎠᎴ ᎤᏙᎯᏳᎯ ᎵᏫ ᏧᏪᏥ ᎠᏥᎸᎨᎳᏍᏗ ᏗᎦᎸᏫᏍᏓᏁᏗ ᎨᏒ ᎨᏥᏁᏗ ᎨᏒᎢ ᎨᎦᏒᎦᎸᏗᏍᎨ ᎠᏍᎪᎯᏁ ᎪᏣᎴᏛ ᏧᏂᏂᏢᏗᏱ ᏴᏫ ᎾᏍᎩᏯ ᏂᎬᏅ ᏗᎧᎿᏩᏛᏍᏗ, ᎾᏍᎩ ᎠᎾᎵᏅᏟ ᎨᏒᎢ, ᎾᏍᏉ ᎡᏆᎭᎻ ᎠᏰᎵ ᏅᏓᏳᎾᏓᎴᏅᎯ ᎨᏒᎢ.
but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises.	ᎾᏍᎩᏍᎩᏂ Ꮎ ᎤᎾᏁᏢᏔᏅᏛ ᎨᏒ ᎵᏫ ᎠᏂᎳᏍᏓᎸ ᏅᏧᏓᎴᏅᎲᎾ ᏥᎩ, ᎠᏍᎪᎯᏁ ᎪᏣᎴᏛ ᏚᏓᏂᎸᏤᎴ ᎡᏆᎭᎻ, ᎠᎴ ᎣᏍᏛ ᎤᏁᏤᎴ ᎠᏚᎢᏍᏔᏅᎯ ᎨᏒ ᏣᎦᎨᏅᏯ.
But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.	ᎠᎴ ᏄᏜᏏᏛᏒᎾ ᎡᏍᎦ ᎢᏯᏥᎸᏉᏗ ᎨᏒ ᎣᏍᏛ ᎤᏁᏤᎰ ᎤᏟ ᎢᏯᏥᎸᏉᏗ.

We can say that through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes,	ᎠᎴ ᎯᎠᏉ ᏱᎾᎩᏪᏒ, ᎵᏫ ᎾᏍᏉ ᎠᏍᎪᎯᏁ ᎪᏣᎴᏛ ᏗᏓᏂᎸᎩ ᏥᎩ, ᎠᏍᎪᎯᏁ ᎪᏣᎴᏛ ᎤᎫᏴᎮ ᎾᎯᏳ ᎡᏆᎭᎻ ᎤᎫᏴᎲ.

Now if there were perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron?

For the priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change made also in the law.	ᎠᏥᎸ-ᎨᎳᏍᏗᏰᏃ ᎨᏒ ᎤᏓᏁᏟᏴᏛ ᎨᏒᎢ, ᎠᏎ ᎾᏍᏉ ᎦᏁᏟᏴᏛ ᏂᎦᎵᏍᏗᎭ ᏗᎧᎿᏩᏛᏍᏗ.
For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.	ᎾᏍᎩᏰᏃ Ꮎ ᎯᎠ ᎾᏍᎩ ᎤᎬᏩᎵ ᎠᏥᏁᎢᏍᏔᏅᎯ ᎨᏒ ᎤᏣᏘᏂ ᎠᏂᎳᏍᏓᎸ ᎨᎳ ᎨᏒᎩ, ᎾᏍᎩ [ᎠᏂᎳᏍᏓᎸ] ᎤᏓᎴᏅᎯ ᎥᏝ ᎩᎶ ᎠᏥᎸᎨᎳᏍᏗᏱ ᏱᏚᎸᏫᏍᏓᏁᎮᎢ.

For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness	ᎤᏙᎯᏳᎯᏰᏃ ᎢᏴᏛ ᎢᎬᏁᎸᎯ ᏂᎦᎵᏍᏗᎭ ᎢᎬᏱᏱ ᎤᎵᏁᏨᎯ ᏗᎧᎿᏩᏛᏍᏗ, ᎠᏩᏂᎦᎳᎯᏳ ᎨᏒ ᎠᎴ ᎬᏩᏓᏍᏕᎸᏗ ᏂᎨᏒᎾ ᎨᏒ ᎢᏳᏍᏗ.

Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,	ᎾᏍᎩᏃ ᎯᎠ ᏥᏗᏃᎮᎭ, ᎯᎠ ᎾᏍᎩ Ꮀ ᏄᎬᏫᏳᏒ ᏂᎦᎵᏍᏗᎭ; ᎾᏍᎩ ᏄᏍᏗ ᎢᎩᎧᎭ ᏄᎬᏫᏳᏒ ᎠᏥᎸ-ᎨᎶᎯ, ᎾᏍᎩ ᎠᎦᏘᏏᏗᏢ ᎦᎸᏉᏗᏳ ᎦᏍᎩᎸ ᎦᎸᎶᎢ ᎤᏪᏅ;
